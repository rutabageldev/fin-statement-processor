# üöÄ Ledgerly Product Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Ledgerly is a personal finance webapp designed to ingest, process, and visualize financial data from multiple sources including direct API connections (Plaid) and manual file uploads (PDFs, CSVs). This roadmap outlines the path to MVP and beyond.

**Current State**: Robust Python parsing microservice with comprehensive testing and quality tooling
**Target MVP**: Full-stack application supporting file upload, data processing, database storage, and basic visualizations
**Architecture**: Monorepo with React frontend, Python backend, PostgreSQL database

---

## üéØ MVP Definition

**Core User Flow**:

1. Upload Citi credit card statement (PDF) and transactions (CSV) simultaneously
2. Automatic parsing and normalization of financial data
3. Data persistence in PostgreSQL database
4. Basic visualizations: monthly spend breakdown and category trends

**Success Criteria**:

- Complete end-to-end flow working reliably
- Responsive web interface
- Data accuracy validated against source documents
- Sub-5-second processing for typical files

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### **Decision 1: Monorepo Structure** ‚úÖ

- **Rationale**: Single developer, simplified deployment, atomic changes across components
- **Structure**: `/frontend` (React), `/backend` (Python), shared Docker compose

### **Decision 2: API-Driven Architecture** ‚úÖ

- **Rationale**: Traditional REST API approach over event-driven for MVP simplicity
- **Future**: Consider event-driven for real-time features post-MVP

### **Decision 3: Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build tool, TailwindCSS styling
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Object Storage**: MinIO (self-hosted S3-compatible) for secure file storage
- **Infrastructure**: Docker compose for development, self-hosted deployment
