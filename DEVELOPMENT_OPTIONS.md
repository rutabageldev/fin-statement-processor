# Ledgerly Development Environment Options

## Current Situation

You're currently in a single development container that was initially scoped for backend-only development. Now that we have a full-stack application with multiple services, we need to choose the best development approach.

## Option 1: Host-Based Development (Recommended)

**How it works:**

- Run all services with `docker compose up -d`
- Develop directly on your host machine
- Services run in containers but you edit files on host
- Auto-reload works via volume mounts

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Best performance (no container overhead for IDE)
- ✅ Access to all services simultaneously
- ✅ Easy to switch between frontend/backend work
- ✅ Native IDE experience
- ✅ Simple debugging setup

**Setup:**

```bash
# Exit the current devcontainer
exit

# From your host machine:
cd fin-statement-processor
./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh

# Edit files directly on host
code .  # or your preferred editor
```

**Development workflow:**

- Frontend: Edit files in `./frontend/`, auto-reloads at http://localhost:3000
- Backend: Edit files in `./backend/`, auto-reloads at http://localhost:8000
- Database: Connect to localhost:5432
- All services communicate through Docker network

## Option 2: Multi-Container DevContainer

**How it works:**

- Updated devcontainer connects to backend service
- Other services (frontend, database, etc.) run alongside
- Switch between containers for different development tasks

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Consistent containerized environment
- ✅ All dependencies isolated
- ✅ Works well with limited host machine setup

**Setup:**

```bash
# Replace current devcontainer config
mv .devcontainer/devcontainer.json.new .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

# Rebuild and reopen in container
# VS Code: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
```

**Development workflow:**

- Primary: Work in backend container (current session)
- Frontend: `docker compose exec frontend bash` for frontend work
- Database: `docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d ledgerly`

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**How it works:**

- Keep current devcontainer for backend development
- Run additional services alongside
- Best of both worlds

**Setup:**

```bash
# Update docker-compose.yaml to include new services
# Keep current devcontainer setup
# Add service dependencies
```

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Host-Based)

For full-stack development, I recommend **Option 1** because:

1. **Performance**: Native IDE performance, no container overhead
2. **Simplicity**: One command starts everything
3. **Productivity**: Easy to work across frontend/backend simultaneously
4. **Debugging**: Better debugging tools access
5. **Learning**: You'll understand Docker networking better

## Migration Steps

If you choose Option 1 (recommended):

1. **Exit current devcontainer**
2. **Run setup script**: `./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh`
3. **Open project in host IDE**: `code .`
4. **Start developing**: All services available via localhost

If you choose Option 2:

1. **Update devcontainer config** (file already created)
2. **Rebuild container**
3. **Continue current workflow** with multi-service access

## Service Access Summary

| Service  | Host-Based (Option 1) | Container-Based (Option 2) |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Frontend | localhost:3000        | localhost:3000             |
| Backend  | localhost:8000        | localhost:8000             |
| Database | localhost:5432        | postgres:5432 (internal)   |
| MinIO    | localhost:9000/9001   | minio:9000 (internal)      |
| Redis    | localhost:6379        | redis:6379 (internal)      |

What would you prefer? I can help implement whichever option works best for your development style.
