# üõ†Ô∏è Ruff Technical Debt Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a prioritized approach to addressing the 37 ignored ruff rules in our `ruff.toml` configuration. The project currently has ~2,359 lines of Python code across 49 files, making this a manageable but important technical debt cleanup effort.

**Current State**: 13 ignored rules across multiple categories (down from 37)
**Progress**: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 completed (24 rules eliminated, ~130+ violations fixed)
**Target State**: Minimal ignores (only formatter conflicts and legitimate exceptions)
**Status**: All technical debt phases completed! Codebase now follows modern Python best practices.

## üö´ Permanent Ignores (Keep These)

These ignores should remain permanently as they conflict with our tooling or are intentional design decisions:

```toml
ignore = [
    # Formatter conflicts - KEEP THESE
    "COM812",  # Trailing comma missing (conflicts with formatter)
    "ISC001",  # Implicit string concatenation (conflicts with formatter)
    "E501",    # Line too long (handled by formatter)

    # TODO management - KEEP THESE (optional)
    "TD002",   # Missing author in TODO
    "TD003",   # Missing issue link in TODO
    "FIX002",  # Line contains TODO

    # Test-specific ignores (handled in per-file-ignores)
    # Move these to per-file-ignores if not already there
]
```

---

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### For Each Phase:

1. **Pre-work**: Run `ruff check --select [RULE_CODES]` to see current violations
2. **Fix**: Address violations systematically
3. **Remove**: Remove the ignore from `ruff.toml`
4. **Verify**: Run full test suite
5. **Document**: Update this roadmap with completion status

### Automation Opportunities:

- **Auto-fixable rules**: Use `ruff check --fix --select [RULE_CODES]`
- **Batch processing**: Group similar rule types together
- **CI Integration**: Add ruff checks to prevent regression

### Risk Mitigation:

- **Feature branch**: Work on dedicated branches per phase
- **Incremental**: One or two rules at a time
- **Testing**: Full test suite after each rule removal
- **Rollback plan**: Keep git history for easy reversion
