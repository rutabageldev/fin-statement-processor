# Post-Migration TODO for New Claude Code Session

## Immediate Actions After Migration

### 1. Verify Environment Setup

- [ ] Run `./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh`
- [ ] Confirm all services are healthy
- [ ] Test frontend access (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Test backend access (http://localhost:8000/docs)
- [ ] Test MinIO console (http://localhost:9001)

### 2. Development Environment Validation

- [ ] Verify hot reload works for frontend changes
- [ ] Verify hot reload works for backend changes
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Confirm file uploads to MinIO work
- [ ] Check logs are accessible via `docker compose logs -f`

### 3. Ready for Phase 2 Development

**Phase 2 Goals** (from PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md):

- [ ] Implement core backend API endpoints
- [ ] Database models and migrations
- [ ] File upload endpoints with MinIO integration
- [ ] Basic authentication system
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration

**Specific Next Tasks:**

- [ ] Create database models using SQLAlchemy
- [ ] Implement FastAPI endpoints per API_SPECIFICATION.md
- [ ] Set up Alembic for database migrations
- [ ] Connect React frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Implement file upload flow

### 4. Development Workflow Commands

**Start/Stop Services:**

```bash
docker compose up -d        # Start all services
docker compose down         # Stop all services
docker compose logs -f      # View all logs
docker compose restart backend  # Restart specific service
```

**Development:**

```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev  # Alternative to Docker

# Backend development
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload  # Alternative to Docker

# Database access
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d ledgerly
```

**Debugging:**

```bash
docker compose ps           # Check service status
docker compose logs backend # Check backend logs
docker compose logs frontend # Check frontend logs
```

## Notes for Claude Code Session

When starting new Claude Code session, mention:

- Using **host-based multi-container development**
- **Phase 1 completed**: Full development environment scaffolding
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Core API and frontend development
- Reference `MIGRATION_TO_HOST.md` for context
- All services accessible via localhost ports

## Architecture Decisions Made

- ✅ **Monorepo structure** over microservice repositories
- ✅ **API-driven architecture** over event-driven
- ✅ **Multi-container development** over single container
- ✅ **Host-based development** over container-based IDE
- ✅ **Self-hosted MinIO** for object storage
- ✅ **TailwindCSS** for frontend styling
- ✅ **FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL** tech stack

- `docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete API design
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Database schema
